# Holling Tanner model

Biology considered a model that describes the interaction between predator and prey populations.

* x1 - number of victims
* x2 - the number of predators

In the absence of predators population of victims can be described with logistic equation. Availability
predators leads to the appearance of the term in the equation OMEGA \* x1 \* X2 / (D + X1). This term describes the decrease in the number of victims due to the hunting of predators.
