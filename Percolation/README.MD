# Percolation theory

## [Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory)

In statistical physics and mathematics, percolation theory describes the behaviour of connected clusters in a random graph. The applications of percolation theory to materials science and other domains are discussed in the article percolation.

## Progect using

* Run `make` to launch the project
* Run `make plot` to plot result without launching the program

Change defines in `main.c` file which are listed below, to control some settings of progect.

```C
#define MATR_DIM 100
```
Here MATR_DIM defines size of output matrix.
